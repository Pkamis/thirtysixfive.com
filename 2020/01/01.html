            There are a so many reasons why I want to do this challenge. I think part of me knows it's an impossible
            task, something I could never accomplish, but isn't that what makes it so enticing? Back when I was still
            in school, I was relatively fit.  I exercised somewhat irregularly, drank and smoked EXTREMELY regularly,
            but I would by no means have labeled myself as a fitness freak.  So it seemed somewhat out of place when I
            decided I was going to run a Half Ironman triathlon. I think the utter joy, pain, exhaustion, and finally
            ecstasy of taking on, and eventually completing that impossible challenge, was the beginning of my
            fascination with pushing myself to limit (queue the Top Gun music). Over the last several years, my life
            has evolved in ways I never thought possible. I've walked my way up the corporate ladder into a stable
            career, I met the love of my life and got married, and together we moved 1500 miles away from our friends,
            family, and the only life we'd known as adults. So I think it's fair to say, that the man I was when I
            decided to take on the Ironman challenge, is nowhere near the man I am today.

            So if I'm not the man I was, why do I still want to push myself to the limit?  I think despite the changes,
            and evolutions of my mind body and soul, I still yearn to be....impressive. Call it arrogance,
            call it pride, call it a shameless disaster of attempted self-improvement, but I think I just want to be a
            better me. Challenges help me do that. They help me understand my limits. What it takes for me to have
            self-control, discipline, and self-awareness. Plus, if I can improve my fitness, improve my writing skills,
            and maybe build a cool blog that a few people want to read in the process, then fuck it, we'll do it live.

            SO, with all the touchy feely bullshit out of the way, lets get down to details.  Oh and first, before
            anyone panics, yes I know today is the first day of the challenge. Yes I worked out. I ran for 30 minutes
            at <a href="https://pricklypearlt.org/project/tenmile-creek-park/">Ten Mile Creek Park</a> in the cold rain over ice and mud. To be honest it was pretty amazing.
            Watching the snow/rain showers come off the Continental Divide, and swing across the Helena valley was
            beautiful. But I digress. <b>DETAILS</b>.

            So the challenge:
              -30 minutes of cardio every day
              -30 minutes of writing every day (which I will post here)

            That's pretty much it. There are a few caveats, such as if I feel to sick or injured to exercise I will
            require a note from a local licensed MD, which I will go to in person for a visit/checkup.

            I haven't yet determined an exhaustive list of what counts as cardio and what doesnt, but I have a few
            items that will get me through the first week or so:

              - Running
              - Cycling (indoors on trainer or outdoor)
              - Snowboarding (this feels a bit like cheating, but it is a workout, and I don't want to punish myself for hitting the slopes)
              - Cross Country Skiing
              - Swimming

            So that's it.  This has been today's 30 minutes of writing.  Stay tuned for more, or don't.
            I honestly don't give a shit.  This is for me, not you.
